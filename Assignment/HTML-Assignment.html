    <h3>Q.1 : Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing ?</h3>
    <p><b>Ans. :</b> No, the HTML tags and elements are not same things</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Q.2 : What are tags and attributes in HTML ?</h3>
    <p><b>Ans. : HTML tags</b> are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an opening bracket followed by the element’s name and, finally, a closing bracket. In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements. As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. The first one is the start tag. It contains two opposite angle brackets.<br>
<b>HTML attribute :</b> is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements. Attributes are used by including them in an opening HTML tag: &lt;tag_name attribute_name="value"&gt;Content&lt;/tag_name&gt;.</p>

    <h3>Q.3 : What are the void elements in the HTML ?</h3>
    <p><b>Ans. :</b> Void elements in HTML are elements that don't have a closing tag and are used to insert content into a web page that doesn't require additional content or nested elements. Instead of a closing tag, void elements are self-closing with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket.

        The following is a list of the void elements in HTML: <br><br>
        
        &lt;area&gt; <br>
        &lt;base&gt; <br>
        &lt;br&gt; <br>
        &lt;col&gt; <br>
        &lt;embed&gt; <br>
        &lt;hr&gt; <br>
        &lt;img&gt; <br>
        &lt;input&gt; <br>
        &lt;link&gt; <br>
        &lt;meta&gt; <br>
        &lt;param&gt; <br>
        &lt;source&gt; <br>
        &lt;track&gt; <br>
        &lt;wbr&gt; <br><br>
        These elements are used to insert images, audio, video, links, and other types of content into a web page, as well as to provide structural elements like line breaks and table columns. Because they don't require a closing tag, they're often used to improve page loading times and simplify HTML code.</p> <br>

        <h3>Q.4 : What are HTMl entities ?</h3>
        <p><b>Ans. : </b>An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Q.5 : What are different types of list in HTML ?</h3>
        <p><b>Ans. :There are three list types in HTML : </b><br>
            <b>1.</b> unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order. <br>
            <b>2.</b> ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order. <br>
            <b>3.</b> description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions.</p><br>
            <hr>
            <h3>Q.6 : What is the 'class' Attribute in HTML ?</h3>
            <p><b>Ans. :</b>The "class" attribute in HTML is used to specify one or more classes for an HTML element. A class is a way to group multiple HTML elements together and apply common styles and behaviors to them using CSS. <br>
                The syntax for adding a class to an HTML element is as follows: <br>
                <b>&lt; tagname class="classname">content &lt;/tagname &gt;</b>
                <hr>
            <h3>Q.7 : What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML 
                elements?</h3>
                <p><b>Ans. : The difference between id & class attribute is given  below :</b><br>
                    <table border="2" class="alt">
                    <tbody><tr>
                    <th>Class</th>

                    <tr>
                    <td>We can apply a class to various elements so that it could be numerous times on a single page.</td>
                    <td>The Id is unique in a page, and we can only apply it to one specific element.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                    <td>The class is assigned to an element and its name starts with "." followed by the name of the class.</td>
                    <td>The name of the Id starts with the "#" symbol followed by a unique id name.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                    <td>We can attach multiple class selectors to an element.</td>
                    <td>We can attach only one ID selector to an element.</td>
                    </tr>

                    <h3>Q.9 : How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing ?</h3>
                    <p><b>Ans. :</b> In HTML, cell padding and cell spacing are both attributes used in table elements to control the layout and appearance of the table cells, but they have different functions.</p>
                    <p>Cell padding refers to the space between the content of a table cell and its border. It determines how much space is added to the top, bottom, left, and right of the cell content. You can set the cell padding using the CSS "padding" property or the HTML "cellpadding" attribute.</p>
                    <p>Cell spacing, on the other hand, refers to the space between adjacent cells in a table. It determines the amount of space between the borders of two neighboring cells, both horizontally and vertically. You can set the cell spacing using the CSS "border-spacing" property or the HTML "cellspacing" attribute.</p><br>
                    <p>To summarize, cell padding is the space between the content and the border of a cell, while cell spacing is the space between adjacent cells in a table.</p><br>

                    <h3>Q.10 :  How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? </h3>
                    <p><b>Ans. :</b> To merge two or more rows into a single row:

                        Identify the cell that you want to span across multiple rows.
                        Add the rowspan attribute to that cell, and set its value to the number of rows you want it to span across.
                        Remove the cells in the affected rows that correspond to the spanned cell. For example, if you have a cell that spans two rows, you should remove one cell in each of the two rows that would be covered by the spanned cell. <br><br>
                        <b>To merge two or more columns into a single column: </b><br><br>
                        
                        Identify the cell that you want to span across multiple columns. <br>
                        Add the colspan attribute to that cell, and set its value to the number of columns you want it to span across. <br>
                        Remove the cells in the affected columns that correspond to the spanned cell. For example, if you have a cell that spans two columns, you should remove one cell in each of the two columns that would be covered by the spanned cell. <br>

                        Note that when you use rowspan or colspan, you need to adjust the number of cells in the affected rows or columns accordingly, so that the table structure remains valid.</p>

                        <h3>Q.11 :  What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML <br>
                        Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.</p><br>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Q.12 : How to create a Hyperlink in HTML ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>With HTML, easily add hyperlinks to any HTML page. Link team page, about page, or even a test by creating it a hyperlink. You can also create a hyperlink for an external website. To make a hyperlink in an HTML page, use the &lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags, which are the tags used to define the links. The &lt;a&gt; tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the &lt;/a&gt; tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the &lt;a href=” ”&gt;. Just keep in mind that you should use the &lt;a&gt;…&lt;/a&gt; tags inside &lt;body&gt;…&lt;/body&gt; tags.</p><br>

                        <h3>Q.13 : What is the use of an iframe tag ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.</p><br>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Q.14 : What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The &lt;span&gt; tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The &lt;span&gt; tag is much like the &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; is a block-level element and &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.</p><br>

                        <h3>Q.15 : How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>The most common & simple way to add background image is using the background image attribute inside the &lt;body&gt; tag. The background attribute which we specified in the &lt;body&gt; tag is not supported in HTML5. Using CSS properties, we can also add background image in a webpage.</p><br>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Q.16 : How are active links different from normal links ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>Active links and normal links are not distinct types of links, but rather they describe the behavior of links when a user interacts with them. A normal link, also known as an inactive link or static link, is a hyperlink that displays a web page or resource when clicked on, but does not change in appearance when a user hovers over it or clicks on it. An active link, also known as a dynamic link or interactive link, responds to user input in some way. For example, an active link may change color or style when a user hovers over it, or it may display a preview of the destination page when a user clicks on it. Active links are generally considered more user-friendly and engaging than normal links because they provide visual feedback and interactivity to the user. They can help guide users through a website or application by highlighting important areas or actions, and can help to make the overall user experience more intuitive and enjoyable.</p><br>

                        <h3>Q.17 :  What are the different tags to separate sections of text ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b> &lt;br&gt; tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line. <br>
                        &lt;p&gt; tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text. <br>
                        &lt;blockquote&gt; tag–This tag is used to define large quoted sections.</p> <br>
                        <hr><h3>Q.18 :  What is SVG ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation. The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1999. SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by the most-used web browsers.</p><br>

                        <h3>Q.19. : What is difference between HTML and XHTML ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, whereas XHTML stands for Extensible Markup Language. <br>
                            All modern browsers support XHTML. <br>
                            A static webpage is an HTML web page and a dynamic web pages are XHTML. <br>
                            HTML is based on SGML while XHTML is based on XML . <br>
                            An XML application of HTML is defined as XHTML. <br>
                            XHTML is “the modern version of HTML 4.</p>

                        <h3>Q.20 : What are logical and physical tags in HTML ?</h3>
                        <p><b>Ans. :</b>In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. There are two types of tags in HTML: logical tags and physical tags. Logical tags describe the meaning or purpose of the content they surround, while physical tags define how the content should be displayed on the page. Logical tags include header tags such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc. which are used to define headings and subheadings on a page. Other logical tags include &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; for lists, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; for emphasizing or highlighting text, and &lt;a&gt; for hyperlinks. Physical tags, on the other hand, describe how the content should be displayed on the page. Examples of physical tags include &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;, which are used to group and style content, &lt;img&gt; for images, &lt;table&gt; for tables, and &lt;form&gt; for input forms.</p> <br>
